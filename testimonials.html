      <p>"Marci is absolutely fantastic and I would highly recommend that anyone speak with her if they are looking to purchase a house in Baltimore! Marci was very helpful and knowledgeable -- she was able to suggest houses to look at that I had not even considered, and as a Baltimore local she was very familiar with different neighborhoods to consider and the pros/cons of each with respect to price, availability of parking, commute times etc. She was also able to suggest and then arrange for contractors for needed repairs to the house, and her handling of the repairs went above and beyond. Marci was also very responsive and approachable in answering questions rapidly and accurately -- she shared her cell phone number with me to be available by text, and was willing to schedule phone calls around my work schedule and even come meet me at my workplace for a few exchanges that needed to happen."<br><br>

      <p>"Marci was amazing to work with. Extremely punctual throughout the entire process to the point where I felt we were her only clients.<br><br>She responded to every call, text, and email with haste and always got us the answers we were searching for.<br><br>After this process we didn’t only buy our first home but feel like we got a friend as well. I would recommend her to anyone."<br><br>

      <p>"Marci was timely, personable, and most importantly honest. Totally in love with my new home, and it’s thanks to her guidance because initially I was looking at places that would not have been ideal for my immediate needs due to looking at potential. What I needed right now was a home and not a project- 5 stars"<br><br>-Nichell M</p>

      <p>"Marci showed me plenty of houses in Canton and was very knowledgeable on what I should look out for when touring the homes. Also, throughout the contract period, she was very helpful staying on top of everything with the other realtor as well as helping me with the mortgage company, inspections, and title company."<br><br>

      <p>"Marci really put in some serious effort to get me into a house, despite a very truncated search period. She made time several days of the week to check houses with me in multiple areas all over Baltimore and several suburbs. Canton, Federal Hill, West Baltimore, etc. Eventually we landed on a nice little Cape Cod up in Essex with an excellent price at asking, and Marci was able to negotiate it even lower! We're 5 weeks into owning the new house, and she is still excellent with regular communication to make sure we have access to the necessary services that pop up, which happens with all new home purchases. More than anything, what really impressed us with Marci was her availability for all our concerns, often as late as 9pm.<br><br>
      I'd recommend Marci for anyone looking to purchase a home in the Baltimore area. She knows her way around town, even the most obscure, microscopic neighborhoods. She's got a strong understanding of house values and how to negotiate prices to ensure the house will appraise for a given offer. She's terrific, and a real joy to work with."<br><br>
